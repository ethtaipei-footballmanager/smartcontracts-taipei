⚽ Ten Taipei Football is an on-chain football manager game that leverages the privacy that TEN provides to hide players' strategies from opponents.

⚙️ Built using Solidity, Hardhat, wagmi, React and Javascript.

- 🧾 **Privacy on TEN**: Players commit to a strategy privately using TEN.
- ⛓️ **Smart contracts**: Verifies strategies and results of the game.
- ⏱️ **Timelock funds**: The wagered amount is secured by a timelock, to prevents ghosting by losing players.
- 🖼️ **Frontend**: Results are generated in the browser based on strategies.
