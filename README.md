‚öΩ Ten Taipei Football Manager is an on-chain football manager game that leverages the privacy that TEN Protocol provides to hide players' strategies from opponents.

\*\* This project is build using frontend components from a previous hackathon project [Super Leo Lig](https://github.com/arjanjohan/aleo-football). All smart contracts and contract interactions are created from scratch during this hackathon.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using Solidity, Hardhat, wagmi, React and Javascript.

- üßæ **Privacy on TEN**: Players commit to a strategy privately using TEN Protocol.
- ‚õìÔ∏è **Smart contracts**: Verifies strategies and results of the game.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Timelock funds**: The wagered amount is secured by a timelock, to prevents ghosting by losing players.
- üñºÔ∏è **Frontend**: Results are generated in the browser based on strategies.

## Game flow

The game has 3 main steps:

### 1: proposeGame

To start a new game, a challenger calls this functions with 3 parameters:

- opponent (address): Address of the opponent
- wagerAmount (uint256): Amount to be wagered in gwei
- formation (uint256): Array of player_id's

This function creates a game object and stores it in a mapping by gameId. The formation is is stored privately in a seperate mapping.

### 2: acceptGame

To accept a game, an opponent calls this functions with 2 parameters:

- gameId (uint256): Unique id for the game
- formation (uint256): Array of player_id's
  This function publicly stored the opponent's formation in the games mapping.

### 3: revealOutcome

Challenger calls this function to settle a game. The function takes 1 input

- gameId (uint256): Unique id for the game

This function reveals challenger formation, determines the outcome and pays out the winner.

### 3b: revealOutcome

Opponent calls this function to settle a game if the challenger does not call revealOutcome within the timelimit. The function takes 1 input

- gameId (uint256): Unique id for the game

This function is only available after X blocks have passed since acceptGame was executed. It pays out the wagered amounts to the opponent, punishing the challenger for ghosting.

## Scripts

To test the smart contract interactions via a script, execute these scripts:
`/scripts/loadPlayers.js` - run once to load player profiles for 6 teams.
`/scripts/gameFlow.js` - run to test a game of two identical teams matched against eachother.
