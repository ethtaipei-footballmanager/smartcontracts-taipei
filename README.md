## Game flow

The game has 3 main steps:

### 1: proposeGame

To start a new game, a challenger calls this functions with 3 parameters:

- opponent (address): Address of the opponent
- wagerAmount (uint256): Amount to be wagered in gwei
- formation (uint256): Array of player_id's

This function creates a game object and stores it in a mapping by gameId. The formation is is stored privately in a seperate mapping.

### 2: acceptGame

To accept a game, an opponent calls this functions with 2 parameters:

- gameId (uint256): Unique id for the game
- formation (uint256): Array of player_id's
  This function publicly stored the opponent's formation in the games mapping.

### 3: revealOutcome

Challenger calls this function to settle a game. The function takes 1 input

- gameId (uint256): Unique id for the game

This function reveals challenger formation, determines the outcome and pays out the winner.

### 3b: revealOutcome

Opponent calls this function to settle a game if the challenger does not call revealOutcome within the timelimit. The function takes 1 input

- gameId (uint256): Unique id for the game

This function is only available after X blocks have passed since acceptGame was executed. It pays out the wagered amounts to the opponent, punishing the challenger for ghosting.
